Full-Stack Scientific Calculator
Project Overview
This is an advanced scientific calculator web application built to showcase a complete, full-stack development workflow. The project consists of a Python backend that handles all the complex mathematical logic and a modern, responsive frontend that handles the user interface.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS (using Tailwind for a responsive design), and JavaScript.

Backend: Python using the Flask web framework.

Features
Full-Stack Architecture: Demonstrates communication between a web frontend and a Python backend API.

Scientific Operations: Includes trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms (log, ln), exponentiation (^), and factorials (!).

Responsive Design: The user interface adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x

pip (the Python package installer)

Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/piinasodu/full-stack-scientific-calculator.git](https://github.com/piinasodu/full-stack-scientific-calculator.git)
cd advanced-calculator

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
Start the Python Backend:
From your project directory, run the Flask application.

flask run

The backend will start and be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Open the Frontend:
Open the index.html file located in the static folder in your web browser. The calculator will now be fully functional and ready for use.
